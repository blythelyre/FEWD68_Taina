	<h1>What life have you lived today?</h1>
		<p>This is the question I ask myself every time I have a moment to just sit and breathe (which are few and far between). I am a writer, a poet, a musician. And now I'm a designer. Life is met to be lived head on, with risks taken. I do not believe in dreams deferred!</p>
